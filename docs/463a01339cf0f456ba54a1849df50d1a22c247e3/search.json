Also note the double-quotes after id=, which are required in XPath.Your intuition may be to just use '//img[@class=\"footer-image\"]'. Sadly, however, this will match only elements with footer-image as their only class. i.e., it will match &lt;img class=\"footer-image\"&gt; but not &lt;img class=\"footer-image another-class\"&gt;. This will usually fail, since most elements on modern webpages have several classes. For example, if the site is using Bootstrap, &lt;p class=\"p-5 m-3\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; creates a paragraph element with a padding of 5 pixels and a margin of 3 pixels."
